In total, 6,953 tweets contained information about valid locations, representing about 10\% of the total of tweets analyzed. Thus, it is possible 
to verify that the seven states posted the most were São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais, Pernambuco, Rio Grande do Sul, Bahia, and Santa Catarina representing 
about 89\% of the total of valid locations. It is not surprising that the Southeast and South states stood out, as they represented the higher-level states of the 
country, which is consequently related with the higher level of access to the internet.


#### Devices Used for Publishing tweets:

The results show that about 47% of Brazilian Twitter users published their tweets through an Android device, 
followed by users who used an IOS device, Twitter Web App, and publications via Instagram (when publishing through this network 
users have also enabled sharing on Twitter).

These figures reflect the Brazilian reality and are in accordance with the data provided by the data analysis company Kantar,
which showed that in September 2020, Google’s Android system dominated the national mobile device market with around 93%,
followed by IOS from Apple with 6.5%, Windows with 0.3% and others with 0.2% [1]. This popularity is because the Google system
has several manufacturers that use Android as an operating system, generating a wide variety of devices with different price ranges, 
enabling many Brazilian socioeconomic classes to acquire a mobile device.
